# Software Engineering 

### Education
Bachelor of Software Engineering

### Introduction
As I progress through my academic and professional journey, I have come to realize that true growth involves not just developing technical proficiency, but also cultivating strong ethical foundations and spiritual maturity. Working in team environments—especially when faced with challenges—has been a significant part of my development. Below, I present experiences that reflect both my professional capabilities and my commitment to personal and spiritual integrity.

### Collaborative Group Work in Multidisciplinary Classes
**Project Description:**
In two different classes, I worked on group-based projects that required coordination, research, and timely execution. These projects involved software documentation, coding tasks, and presentation preparation. While the expectations were clear, not all team members met them equally.
**Professional Challenge:**
A recurring issue was unequal contribution—particularly when some members failed to manage their time effectively or deliver quality work. In several instances, I and a few others had to take on responsibilities assigned to someone else in order to meet deadlines and uphold academic standards.

### Projects
**Real Estate Management System**: A console-based real estate management system with two main modules: Listings and Bids. Users can add, view, or auto-generate detailed property listings, including residence type, address, size, and pricing. In the Bids module, users can place bids, view existing ones, and track bidding activity per property. Designed for internal use, the app includes development tools and direct console input for efficient property and bid management

**Dessert Shop**:  A console-based dessert ordering system where users can create custom orders with items like candy, cookies, ice cream, and sundaes. Features include item detail input, payment method selection, automated receipt generation, and customer tracking with unique IDs. Designed as a simple, interactive POS system for small dessert vendors.

**BlackJack Game**: A Java-based Blackjack game combining object-oriented programming with a custom graphical interface. Features include structured class components (e.g., BJDeck, BJHand), logic testing, and a visually styled GUI with custom colors and layout. The game simulates traditional Blackjack between a player and dealer, serving as an educational project to reinforce Java GUI development, class design, and modular architecture.
