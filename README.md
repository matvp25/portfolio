- Real Estate: This application is a console-based real estate management system that allows users to interact with property listings and bids. Upon launching the app, users are presented with a main menu that includes two primary options: Listings and Bids. Within the Listings section, users can add new property listings, view existing listings, or auto-populate sample listings using a development tool. Each listing includes detailed property information such as residence type, address, zip code, square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, yard or floor details, as well as appraisal and list prices.
In the Bids section, users can submit new bids on available properties, view bids already placed, or use a development tool to auto-generate bids. Properties are listed with the number of bids theyâ€™ve received, allowing users to select a property and view its associated bidding activity. The system appears to be structured for internal use, such as by a real estate agency or development team, given its inclusion of dev tools and direct console input prompts.
