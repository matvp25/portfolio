### Projects
**Real Estate**: A console-based real estate management system with two main modules: Listings and Bids. Users can add, view, or auto-generate detailed property listings, including residence type, address, size, and pricing. In the Bids module, users can place bids, view existing ones, and track bidding activity per property. Designed for internal use, the app includes development tools and direct console input for efficient property and bid management

**Dessert Shop**:  A console-based dessert ordering system where users can create custom orders with items like candy, cookies, ice cream, and sundaes. Features include item detail input, payment method selection, automated receipt generation, and customer tracking with unique IDs. Designed as a simple, interactive POS system for small dessert vendors.

**BlackJack Game**: A Java-based Blackjack game combining object-oriented programming with a custom graphical interface. Features include structured class components (e.g., BJDeck, BJHand), logic testing, and a visually styled GUI with custom colors and layout. The game simulates traditional Blackjack between a player and dealer, serving as an educational project to reinforce Java GUI development, class design, and modular architecture.

### Ethical Dilemma Analysis
**Theme**: Integrity in Code and Character
  
During a group software engineering project, one of my teammates submitted code that they had copied directly from an online repository without any attribution. The code was part of a core functionality we were assigned to build ourselves, and it immediately raised red flags for me during a code review. At first, I wasn't sure how to handle the situation. I knew reporting the issue might damage our team’s dynamic and possibly get my teammate in trouble, but ignoring it would make me complicit in academic dishonesty and go against my personal values.
I decided to speak to the teammate privately and asked about the origin of the code. They admitted to copying it, saying they were overwhelmed and didn’t want to fall behind. I empathized with their stress but explained the seriousness of the situation. After giving it some thought, I decided to report the incident to our instructor, but I also offered to help the teammate rewrite the code from scratch so we could submit original work.

This experience taught me that ethical decisions are rarely easy, especially when they involve people you work closely with. According to the ACM Code of Ethics, being honest and respecting others' intellectual work are core professional responsibilities. Upholding these values not only protects my credibility but also reinforces the culture of integrity in software development. Ultimately, acting with integrity meant having the courage to do what was right, even when it was uncomfortable.
